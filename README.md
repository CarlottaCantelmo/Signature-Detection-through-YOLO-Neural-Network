# Signature-Detection-through-YOLO-Neural-Network

The subject considered in this thesis is a categorization problem: the objective is to utilize a model that takes documents as input and organizes them based on whether or not they present a signature. The information from this classification allows us to select and organize signed documents. YOLO is a special Neural Network because it has an architecture that is incredibly fast. Because the entire detection pipeline consists of a single network and can be improved end-to-end based solely on detection performance.
